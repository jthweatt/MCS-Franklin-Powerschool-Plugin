## [1.1.2] - 2021-09-30

### Fixed

- Corrected the script for the students named query to return only fully enrolled students. Script will now only return rows where student.enroll_status = 0. This eliminates the issue of provisional enrollments being exported until the provision is cleared.

## [1.1.1] - 2021-09-14

### Fixed

- Corrected the script for the students named query to not return duplicate rows for the same homeroom course with different terms. Script will now only return rows where student.student_statenumber is not null and cc.termid matches the year specified in the script file.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-08-03

### Added

- Added logic to the students named query to return the column "Home_room" as a concattenated string of the Homeroom teacher's section number and last name as "#### lastname".

## [1.0.0] - 2021-07-20

- Initial release build.
